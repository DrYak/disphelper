DispHelper C samples:
Each of the .c files in this directory contains a sample program demonstrating using
one or more COM objects.

Compiling the samples:
For simplicity in compiling the samples, I have provided compile batch files.
The idea is to drag the file you want to compile onto the appropriate batch file.
Before you do that you may have to do two things:
1. Put a copy of disphelper.c and disphelper.h in this directory if they are not present.
2. Edit the appropriate batch file to set the correct paths. Typically, this will not be needed.

Alternatively, you can set up a new project in your IDE. Simply add
disphelper.c, disphelper.h and the sample you want to compile to a new project.

---------
DispHelper COM Helper Library:

DispHelper allows you to call COM objects with an extremely simple printf style syntax.
DispHelper can be used from C++ or even plain C. It works with most Windows compilers
including Dev-CPP, Visual C++ and LCC-WIN32. Including DispHelper in your project
couldn't be simpler as it is available in a compacted single file version.

Included with DispHelper are over 20 samples that demonstrate using COM objects
including ADO, CDO, Outlook, Eudora, Excel, Word, Internet Explorer, MSHTML,
PocketSoap, Word Perfect, MS Agent, SAPI, MSXML, WIA, dexplorer and WMI.

DispHelper is free open source software provided under the BSD license.

DispHelper single file source:

To use DispHelper, simply add disphelper.c and disphelper.h to your project.
For Visual C++, Borland C++ and LCC-Win32 import libraries are included via
pragma directives. For other compilers you may need to add ole32, oleaut32 and uuid.
To do this in Dev-CPP add "-lole32 -loleaut32 -luuid" to the linker box under
Project->Project Options->Parameters.

If you are using Dev-CPP and get errors when compiling disphelper.c:
Make sure disphelper.c is set to compile as C and not C++ under Project->Project Options->Files.
